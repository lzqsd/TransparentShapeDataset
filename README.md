## Dataset Links
Followings are the links to our dataset, to understand the data structure of our dataset, please refer to the dataset creation repository from this [link](https://github.com/lzqsd/TransparentShapeDatasetCreation) and the network repository from this [link](https://github.com/lzqsd/TransparentShapeReconstruction), which will tell you how the data are created and how to load the data for training. We also provide our final reconstruction results of 10-view, 20-view and 5-view reconstruction so that future researchers can compare with our method easily.
